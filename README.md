Using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis focuses on understanding the dataset's characteristics,
identifying relationships between features, and uncovering insights for predicting housing values.
Key steps include data loading and initial exploration, univariate and bivariate analysis,
feature engineering, and correlation analysis.
